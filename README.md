# XmlDocToMarkdown

A .NET Core application to translate C# XML comments into Markdown.

Specify the location of the XML file to read in and the name of the Markdown file to write to, and it'll generate the code.

## Is it any good?

It's a bit simplistic and prototypey. [Vsxmd](https://github.com/lijunle/Vsxmd) is a better production option at the moment.
